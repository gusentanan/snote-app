## Simple Note App using Flutter

I built this app with the sole purpose of learning how to do the declarative approach in building UI using the Flutter framework, while also incorporating recommended libraries. The note app offers simple features such as adding, updating, and deleting notes, but I also included a priority feature to help you identify which notes are most important. The app also follows a clean architecture, with separate UI and data layers. While this may seem like overkill, I wanted to build the app as a way to learn Flutter.

### Tech Stack
- `BloC` make it easier to manage and update the state of an app in response to user interaction or other events
- `sqflite` for local database processing.
- `dartz`  null safety management.
- `Equatable` simplify the process of implementing equality checks between objects.
- `get_it` for managing dependencies accross the app
- `flutter smart dialog` To make it easier to create custom dialog boxes and toast messages.

### How to run
- `cd mynotes` to move to the project dir. 
- `flutter pub get` to get all the dependencies.
- Then `flutter run` to run the app.
